## Background

This summer (2019) my neighborhood had a special opportunity to work with the local Sikh community to plant 200+ trees in our neighborhood. I worked with a small committee of neighbors to organize this effort, including utilizing open-source and free/cheap technologies to move beyond door-to-door paper forms. In this post I will describe how to utilize free/cheap technologies for building community, and the lessons I learned about engaging community.

Our committee consisted of about ten people of various backgrounds: experienced community members who have had lots of involvement in many community efforts, tree enthuseasts who had organized similar efforts in the past, and younger / newer community members like myself who are not used to working on community efforts. I am not a tree expert, but I am excited about more trees in the neighborhood. 

Working in the IT field, specifically in the higher education industry in the health domain, I am used to working on projects outside my academic expertise; working with this committee was not unlike working on any other work project. 

Because several people in the group had experience with local tree plantings already, much of the legwork was already done and just needed tweaked. My idea for the group was to take what we had and make it available digitally. 

## Web technologies
The trick to my efforts was that any solutions I used needed to be as cheap as possible, relatively easy for non-tech people to grok, and I needed to be able to work as quickly as possible. I had a few broad ideas in mind:
- Buy a domain
- A static site generator for a website
- GitHub as source control
- Any free tier cloud hosting (hopefully integrating into Git)
- Google Forms / Google Docs

With that in mind I settled on Vuepress because I use VueJS in my work, and it seemed very quick to get something up and running and looking decent. The default theme is even green, so it fit with the plant theme. I used Heroku because I already used it for a few other things, and it's easy to integrate with a GitHub repository. The domain name was the only piece that I did not try to find a free option for, because I already have multiple domains through a certain registrar.
